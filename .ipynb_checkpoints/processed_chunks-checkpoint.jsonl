The \nfollowing discussion provides an \noverview of the public comment \nreceived on this proposal. Additional \ncomments received on this issue are \ndiscussed below in the section entitled, \n\u2018\u2018Response to Other Public Comments.\u2019\u2019 \nNumerous commenters supported the \nproposed modifications. Generally, \nthese commenters claimed the \nmodifications would prevent \ninconvenience to consumers, and \nfacilitate timely access to health care. \nSpecifically, these commenters \nindicated that health care would be \ndelayed and consumers would be \ninconvenienced if covered entities were \nrequired to obtain individual consent or \nauthorization before they could access \nhealth records that are newly acquired \nassets resulting from the sale, transfer, \nmerger, or consolidation of all or part of \na covered entity.
