of persons, to whom the covered entity 
may make the requested use or 
disclosure.

expiration event that relates to the 
individual or the purpose of the use or

must contain statements adequate to 
place the individual on notice of all of 
the following:

condition treatment, payment, 
enrollment or eligibility for benefits on

authorization when the prohibition on 
conditioning of authorizations in 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section applies; 
or 
(B) The consequences to the 
individual of a refusal to sign the 
authorization when, in accordance with 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the 
covered entity can condition treatment, 
enrollment in the health plan, or
